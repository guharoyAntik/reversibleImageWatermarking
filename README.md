# Reversible Image Watermarking Application
A python GUI application to perform reversible image watermarking. 

Reversible image watermarking is a data hiding technique in which we embed an image into another image that can later be retrieved, for protection and authentication. This is an implementation of a modified version of histogram shifting reversible image watermarking where instead of minimum bin we use the second maximum bin for histogram shifting.

For more details on the original histogram shifting technique, you can read [here](https://www.irjet.net/archives/V4/i1/IRJET-V4I114.pdf).
